## 1. Litany of Chastity

**O Jesus, meek and humble of heart, make our hearts like unto Thine.**

From every sin against chastity, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From every impure thought, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From every impure word, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From every impure action, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From every occasion of sin, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From the spirit of impurity, **deliver us, O Lord.**
From all evil desires, **deliver us, O Lord.**

**Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, spare us, O Lord.**
**Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, graciously hear us, O Lord.**
**Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us, O Lord.**

**Pray for us, O Saint Joseph,**
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray: O God, who has given us the commandment to be pure of heart, grant us the grace to serve Thee with a clean heart and a chaste body. Through Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

## 2. Guardian Angel Prayer

To whom His love commits me here,
Ever this day be at my side,
To light and guard, to rule and guide.
**Amen.**

keep my soul and body;
direct my thoughts, my words, and works;

**O God, come to my assistance.**
O Lord, make haste to help me.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. **Amen.**

## Examination of Conscience

Take a moment to reflect on your day:
- What am I grateful for today?
- Where did I fall short of Christ''s example?
- How can I grow in virtue tomorrow?

## Act of Contrition

**O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,**
and I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishments,
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God,
who art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,
to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
**Amen.**

## Night Prayer

**Now I lay me down to sleep,**
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
**Amen.**
